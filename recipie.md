1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil and flour three 9 by 1 1/2-inch round cake pans.

3. with a standing mixer, mix the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients until a smooth batter is formed.

4. Divide the cake batter evenly among the prepared cake pans. Place the pans in the oven spaced apart. Bake, and rotate the pans halfway in the cooking, until the cake pulls away from the side of the pans, and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, this takes about 30 minutes.

5. Remove the cakes from the oven, get a knife and run it around the edges to loosen them from the sides of the pans. One at a time, invert the cakes onto a plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up. and let it cool completely.
